# The Graham Center at Penn State York Contruction Timelapse
**Date:**  August-October 2019  
**Organization:** Penn State University


## Problem Description:
At Penn State York, there was a need for a timelapse of the contruction of a new bulding called the "Graham Center for
Innovation and Collaboration."  This timelapse would be in the form of a video file **(.mp4)** and would
need to be updated on a regular basis.  This video would be hosted on the Penn State York website for users to view and 
see the current state of the construction project.

## Brainstorming
My approach was to use a combination of the Python programming language, Unix shell scripting, and Box file hosting to create
a system that would create a new timelapse video file daily.  This would allow for an almost real-time look into how far along the
project is.

## Steps
1. Generating pictures to be compiled  
A outside webcam was set up to generate and save a picture file every day at noon to a Box file hosting folder
